# Stream Feeds Roadmap
[comment]: <> TODO: add a sub bullets to elaborate more on how to do these tasks
- interact efficiently with getstream sdk to create and related feed
- find out the complexity and relations of Stream's users and feed
- come up with a solution for connecting feeds to database 
- indexing the feed's activities in the Search Engine ( Probably Algolia)

## Qeustions
- how to add images in activities? is it possible?
- what are each post's feilds
- how stream handles database and storing? what WE need to store?
- What is the difference between activity group, and feeds?
